In parallel, an effective transfer learning method called ULMFiT showed that training long short-term memory (LSTM) networks on a very large and diverse corpus could produce state-of-the-art text classifiers with little labeled data. 2 These advances were the catalysts for two of today's most well-known transformers: the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) 3 and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). 4 By combining the Transformer architecture with unsupervised learning, these models removed the need to train task-specific architectures from scratch and broke almost every benchmark in NLP by a significant margin. Since the release of GPT and BERT, a zoo of transformer models has emerged; a timeline of the most prominent entries is shown in Figure 1-1. 1 A.

These architectures contain a feedback loop in the network connections that allows information to propagate from one step to another, making them ideal for modeling sequential data like text. As illustrated on the left side of Figure 1-2, an RNN receives some input (which could be a word or character), feeds it through the network, and outputs a vector called the hidden state . At the same time, the model feeds some information back to itself through the feedback loop, which it can then use in the next step. This can be more clearly seen if we 'unroll' the loop as shown on the right side of Figure 1-2: the RNN passes information about its state at each step to the next operation in the sequence. This allows an RNN to keep track of information from previous steps, and use it for its output predictions. Figure 1-2. Unrolling an RNN in time",

On the left side, a single RNN cell is shown with an input at time step t and a corresponding state output. This cell is then \"unrolled\" horizontally to represent multiple time steps, from State 1 to State t, each connected sequentially. Each unrolled RNN cell receives an input at its respective time step (Input 1, Input 2, etc.) and produces a state output that is passed to the next cell in the sequence. This unrolling allows the network to maintain a form of memory by carrying information forward through the sequence, enabling it to capture temporal dependencies effectively. The diagram visually emphasizes how the same RNN cell is reused across different time steps, highlighting the recursive nature of these networks. These architectures were (and continue to be) widely used for NLP tasks, speech processing, and time series. You can find a wonderful exposition of their capabilities in Andrej Karpathy's blog post, 'The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks'. One area where RNNs played an important role was in the development of machine translation systems, where the objective is to map a sequence of words in one language to another. This kind of task is usually tackled with an encoder-decoder or sequence-to-sequence architecture, 5 which is well suited for situations where the input and output are both sequences of arbitrary length. The job of the encoder is to encode the information from the input sequence into a numerical representation that is often called the last hidden state . This state is then passed to the decoder, which generates the output sequence. In general, the encoder and decoder components can be any kind of neural network architecture that can model sequences. This is illustrated for a pair of RNNs in Figure 1-3, where the English sentence 'Transformers are great!' is encoded as a hidden state vector that is then decoded to produce the German translation 'Transformer sind grossartig!' The input words are fed sequentially through the encoder and the output words are generated one at a time, from top to bottom. 5 I. Sutskever, O. Vinyals, and Q.V .

On the left side, the encoder block processes an input sequence (\"Transformers are great!\") through a series of RNN cells, each passing along a hidden state until the final cell outputs a compressed representation, referred to as the \"State.\" This state encapsulates the entire input sequence's meaning and is then fed into the decoder block on the right. The decoder block also consists of RNN cells, which use the encoded state to generate the output sequence (\"Transformer sind grossartig!\"). The diagram highlights the challenge of compressing the entire input sequence into a single state, which can lead to an information bottleneck, particularly for longer sequences. Although elegant in its simplicity, one weakness of this architecture is that the final hidden state of the encoder creates an information bottleneck : it has to represent the meaning of the whole input sequence because this is all the decoder has access to when generating the output. This is especially challenging for long sequences, where information at the start of the sequence might be lost in the process of compressing everything to a single, fixed representation. Fortunately, there is a way out of this bottleneck by allowing the decoder to have access to all of the encoder's hidden states. The general mechanism for this is called attention , 6 and it is a key component in many modern neural network architectures. Understanding how attention was developed for RNNs will put us in good shape to understand one of the main building blocks of the Transformer architecture. Let's take a deeper look.",

However, using all the states at the same time would create a huge input for the decoder, so some mechanism is needed to prioritize which states to use. This is where attention comes in: it lets the decoder assign a different amount of weight, or 'attention, ' to each of the encoder states at every decoding timestep. This process is illustrated in Figure 1-4, where the role of attention is shown for predicting the third token in the output sequence. 6 D. Bahdanau, K. Cho, and Y.

On the left side, the encoder block processes the input sequence \"Transformers are great!\" through a series of recurrent neural network (RNN) cells, generating hidden states (State 1 to State 4) that capture the context of the input tokens. These states are then passed to the decoder block on the right, which also consists of RNN cells. The decoder generates the output sequence \"sind grossartig!\" token by token, with the attention mechanism dynamically selecting the most relevant parts of the encoder's hidden states for each decoding step. This allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence as needed, improving its ability to handle complex translations and maintain alignment between the source and target languages. By focusing on which input tokens are most relevant at each timestep, these attention-based models are able to learn nontrivial alignments between the words in a generated translation and those in a source sentence. For example, Figure 1-5 visualizes the attention weights for an English to French translation model, where each pixel denotes a weight. The figure shows how the decoder is able to correctly align the words 'zone' and ' Area' , which are ordered differently in the two languages. Figure 1-5.

The English sentence, \"The agreement on the European Economic Area was signed in August 1992,\" is aligned with its French counterpart, \"L'accord sur la zone économique européenne a été signé en août 1992.\" The alignment is visualized through a heatmap where each cell represents the attention weight between a word in the source language (English) and a word in the target language (French). Brighter cells indicate higher alignment scores, showing how the model associates specific words across languages. This visualization helps understand the model's focus during translation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the attention mechanism in capturing semantic relationships between words. | Although attention enabled the production of much better translations, there was still a major shortcoming with using recurrent models for the encoder and decoder: the computations are inherently sequential and cannot be parallelized",

With the transformer, a new modeling paradigm was introduced: dispense with recurrence altogether, and instead rely entirely on a special form of attention called self-attention . We'll cover self-attention in more detail in Chapter 3, but the basic idea is to allow attention to operate on all the states in the same layer of the neural network. This is shown in Figure 1-6, where both the encoder and the decoder have their own self-attention mechanisms, whose outputs are fed to feed-forward neural networks (FF NNs).

The Decoder block then uses these states along with its own attention mechanism and FF NN layers to produce the translated output sequence \"Transformer sind grossartig!\" The diagram highlights the flow of information and the role of attention mechanisms in both encoding and decoding phases, emphasizing the core components that enable the Transformer's effectiveness in natural language processing tasks. In the original Transformer paper, the translation model was trained from scratch on a large corpus of sentence pairs in various languages.

Architecturally, this involves splitting the model into of a body and a head , where the head is a task-specific network. During training, the weights of the body learn broad features of the source domain, and these weights are used to initialize a new model for the new task. 7 Compared to traditional supervised learning, this approach typically produces high-quality models that can be trained much more 7 Weights are the learnable parameters of a neural network. 6 | Chapter 1: Hello Transformers efficiently on a variety of downstream tasks, and with much less labeled data.

On the left side, representing supervised learning, two separate models (Model A and Model B) are trained independently on their respective domains (Domain A and Domain B), leading to distinct predictions (Predictions A and Predictions B). Each model is built from scratch without leveraging any prior knowledge. In contrast, the right side depicts transfer learning, where a single model body (Body A) is initially trained on Domain A and then its learned features are transferred and fine-tuned for Domain B. This shared body initializes the training for the new domain, resulting in a more efficient and effective model (Body A with Head B) that produces Predictions B. The key advantage highlighted is the ability to extract and reuse knowledge from one task to enhance performance on another related task. In computer vision, the models are first trained on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet, which contain millions of images. This process is called pretraining and its main purpose is to teach the models the basic features of images, such as edges or colors. These pretrained models can then be fine-tuned on a downstream task such as classifying flower species with a relatively small number of labeled examples (usually a few hundred per class). Fine-tuned models typically achieve a higher accuracy than supervised models trained from scratch on the same amount of labeled data. Although transfer learning became the standard approach in computer vision, for many years it was not clear what the analogous pretraining process was for NLP . As a result, NLP applications typically required large amounts of labeled data to achieve high performance. And even then, that performance did not compare to what was achieved in the vision domain. In 2017 and 2018, several research groups proposed new approaches that finally made transfer learning work for NLP. It started with an insight from researchers at OpenAI who obtained strong performance on a sentiment classification task by using features extracted from unsupervised pretraining. 8 This was followed by ULMFiT, which introduced a general framework to adapt pretrained LSTM models for various tasks. 9 As illustrated in Figure 1-8, ULMFiT involves three main steps:",

Finding ways to bridge this gap is an active area of NLP research and activism. GPT Uses only the decoder part of the Transformer architecture, and the same language modeling approach as ULMFiT.

Preprocess the inputs, pass them through the model, and apply some taskspecific postprocessing. 4. Implement dataloaders and define loss functions and optimizers to train the model. 11 Y.

However, this code is rarely standardized and often requires days of engineering to adapt to new use cases. This is where Transformers comes to the NLP practitioner's rescue! It provides a standardized interface to a wide range of transformer models as well as code and tools to adapt these models to new use cases. The library currently supports three major deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX) and allows you to easily switch between them. In addition, it provides task-specific heads so you can easily fine-tune transformers on downstream tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, and question answering. This reduces the time it takes a practitioner to train and test a handful of models from a week to a single afternoon!

The second time you instantiate the pipeline, the library will notice that you've already downloaded the weights and will use the cached version instead. By default, the text-classification pipeline uses a model that's designed for sentiment analysis, but it also supports multiclass and multilabel classification. Now that we have our pipeline, let's generate some predictions! Each pipeline takes a string of text (or a list of strings) as input and returns a list of predictions. Each prediction is a Python dictionary, so we can use Pandas to display them nicely as a DataFrame : ![Image](E:\\CODE\\RAG\\Documents\\output\\part1_artifacts\\image_000009_6e88fadc1f71b313be8bb814482f1bd5ebc806eecbb26e78114a80e78df40035.png) *Image Description:* The image shows a brief code snippet and its output, illustrating how to use a sentiment analysis classifier with a pipeline. The code imports the `pandas` library and applies the `classifier` function to a piece of text, storing the result in the variable `outputs`. This output is then converted into a Pandas DataFrame for better readability. The resulting table displays a single row indicating that the sentiment of the analyzed text is \"NEGATIVE\" with a high confidence score of approximately 0.901546, suggesting that the model is quite certain about the negative sentiment of the input text. In this case the model is very confident that the text has a negative sentiment, which makes sense given that we're dealing with a complaint from an angry customer! Note that for sentiment analysis tasks the pipeline only returns one of the POSITIVE or NEG ATIVE labels, since the other can be inferred by computing 1-score .

The overall effect is clean, modern, and visually appealing, capturing the essence of the bird with minimal detail. See those weird hash symbols ( # ) in the word column in the previous table?

As shown in Figure 1-10, there are filters for tasks, frameworks, datasets, and more that are designed to help you navigate the Hub and quickly find promising candidates. As we've seen with the pipelines, loading a promising model in your code is then literally just one line of code away. This makes experimenting with a wide range of models simple, and allows you to focus on the domain-specific parts of your project. Figure 1-10.

On the left side, there are various filters organized into categories such as Tasks (e.g., Fill-Mask, Question Answering, Summarization), Libraries (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX), and Datasets (e.g., Wikipedia, Common Voice). These filters allow users to narrow down their search based on specific criteria. On the right side, a list of models is presented, including popular ones like bert-base-uncased, xlm-roberta-base, roberta-large, distilbert-base-uncased, and gpt2. Each model entry includes details such as its task type, update date, number of downloads, and likes, facilitating easy navigation and selection for users looking to leverage these resources for their applications or research. In addition to model weights, the Hub also hosts datasets and scripts for computing metrics, which let you reproduce published results or leverage additional data for your application. The Hub also provides model and dataset cards to document the contents of models and datasets and help you make an informed decision about whether they're the right ones for you. One of the coolest features of the Hub is that you can try out any model directly through the various task-specific interactive widgets as shown in Figure 1-11. ![Image](E:\\CODE\\RAG\\Documents\\output\\part1_artifacts\\image_000013_d4712d76a559b9b13347365ec331a4b72c53cf0f0674fad3797f1c83e72c50f4.png) *Image Description:* The image displays a model card for the BERT base model (uncased) on the Hugging Face Hub, providing detailed information about the model's purpose and usage. On the left side, there is a description of the model, explaining that it is a pretrained transformer model on English data using masked language modeling (MLM) and noting that it is uncased. Below this, there is a disclaimer stating that the model card was written by the Hugging Face team. On the right side, there is an interactive inference widget where users can input text with a masked token (e.g., \"[MASK]\") and click \"Compute\" to see the model's predictions for the masked word. The widget shows a sample input sentence and lists the top predicted words along with their confidence scores, such as \"watch,\" \"phone,\" \"face,\" etc. Additionally, there is a graph indicating the number of downloads over the past month and options for training, deploying, and using the model in Transformers.

The bird is shown in profile, facing left, with its beak slightly open as if it is about to vocalize. Its wings are neatly folded along its body, and its legs are positioned as though it is standing firmly. The crow is enclosed within a simple rectangular frame that complements the minimalist design of the illustration. The overall aesthetic is clean and modern, with a focus on the crow's distinctive features such as its sharp beak and piercing eye.

We'll see how this works in detail in Chapter 2, but for now it's enough to understand that tokens may be words, parts of words, or just characters like punctuation. Transformer models are trained on numerical representations of these tokens, so getting this step right is pretty important for the whole NLP project! Tokenizers provides many tokenization strategies and is extremely fast at tokenizing text thanks to its Rust backend. 12 It also takes care of all the pre- and postprocessing steps, such as normalizing the inputs and transforming the model outputs to the required format. With Tokenizers, we can load a tokenizer in the same way we can load pretrained model weights with Transformers. 12 Rust is a high-performance programming language. We need a dataset and metrics to train and evaluate models, so let's take a look at Datasets, which is in charge of that aspect.",

In addition, you usually need to implement various scripts to download the data and transform it into a standard format. Datasets simplifies this process by providing a standard interface for thousands of datasets that can be found on the Hub. It also provides smart caching (so you don't have to redo your preprocessing each time you run your code) and avoids RAM limitations by leveraging a special mechanism called memory mapping that stores the contents of a file in virtual memory and enables multiple processes to modify a file more efficiently. The library is also interoperable with popular frameworks like Pandas and NumPy, so you don't have to leave the comfort of your favorite data wrangling tools. Having a good dataset and powerful model is worthless, however, if you can't reliably measure the performance. Unfortunately, classic NLP metrics come with many different implementations that can vary slightly and lead to deceptive results. By providing the scripts for many metrics, Datasets helps make experiments more reproducible and the results more trustworthy.",

' In the following chapters you will learn how to adapt transformers to a wide range of use cases, such as building a text classifier, or a lightweight model for production, or even training a language model from scratch. We'll be taking a hands-on approach, which means that for every concept covered there will be accompanying code that you can run on Google Colab or your own GPU machine. Now that we're armed with the basic concepts behind transformers, it's time to get our hands dirty with our first application: text classification. That's the topic of the next chapter!",
